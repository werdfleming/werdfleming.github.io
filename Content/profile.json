  "AboutText": "Hi, I am Andrew Fleming. I am an electrical engineering student at Seattle Pacific University with a growing passion for software and hardware working together. I like digging into projects where I can actually build something that works, whether that is a control system, a microgrid idea, or a piece of code that solves a problem I have been wrestling with. I enjoy learning new tools and figuring things out as I go. Most of my best work has come from collaborating with classmates and bouncing ideas around until something clicks. Outside of class I usually end up working on side projects or helping friends with their own builds because I like seeing how different people approach problems. I care a lot about growing my skills and staying curious, and I try to take every chance I get to learn something new."
