  "AboutText": "Hi, I am Andrew Fleming. I am an electrical engineering student at Seattle Pacific University with a growing passion for software and hardware working together. I like digging into projects where I can actually build something that works, whether that is a control system, a microgrid idea, or a piece of code that solves a problem I have been wrestling with. I enjoy learning new tools and figuring things out as I go. Most of my best work has come from collaborating with classmates and bouncing ideas around until something clicks. Outside of class I usually end up working on side projects or helping friends with their own builds because I like seeing how different people approach problems. I care a lot about growing my skills and staying curious, and I try to take every chance I get to learn something new."

"Experience": {
  "ExperienceText": "I have grown a lot by taking on projects that stretch me, especially my current work building a small-scale airborne wind generator for my senior design project. It has pushed my skills in power systems, controls, and real hands on problem solving. I am wrapping up my final year and getting ready to step into a career in sustainable energy, confident in the work I have done and the direction I am heading.",
  "School": "Seattle Pacific University",
  "Major": "Electrical Engineering",
  "Graduation": "June 2026",
  "EducationText": "I am a senior Electrical Engineering student at Seattle Pacific University, minoring in Appropriate and Sustainable Engineering. My coursework in electronics, signals, and microgrids has shaped how I approach real engineering problems, and my roles as a Lead Resident Advisor and IEEE Vice President have strengthened my communication and leadership. My studies also led me into airborne wind energy research, which I am continuing through my small scale airborne wind generator project.",

"Project1": {
    "Title": "Personal Weather Probe",
    "Desc": "For my Junior Design project, I built an autonomous water weather probe that measured temperature at multiple depths. I designed the system to lower a sensor into the water, record readings at each level, and log the data for later analysis. The project required mechanical design, sensor integration, and microcontroller programming, and it gave me experience creating a device that could operate reliably on its own in real conditions. ",

  "Project2": {
    "Title": "Laser Tag Blasters",
    "Desc": "For my microcontroller class, I designed and built a pair of laser tag blasters using a Raspberry Pi Pico as the main controller. Each blaster fired an infrared signal and included a safety system to prevent accidental firing during startup. I programmed the devices to detect hits and added a small speaker that buzzed when you shot another player or when you were hit. The project pulled together coding, circuit design, and troubleshooting, and it ended up being a fun and fully working system.",

    "Title": "PCB Design",
    "Desc": "I designed and built a custom PCB for a dual adjustable power supply, handling the full schematic and board layout in Altium. I chose the components, routed the power and control sections, and refined the layout for safe and stable voltage regulation. After fabrication, I assembled and soldered the entire board, producing a reliable custom power system.",
